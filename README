devbox is debugging SMTP server bound to localhost. Useful
for when you need to test outgoing mail but do not want any
mail actually sent. All incoming  messages are saved in a maildir 
for later perusal regardless of any possible address. 
What comes in won't come out.

There are several mail readers that can handle maildir format, evolution, balsa, pine and mutt are examples.
Default port is 25 and default directory for the maildir is ~/.devbox

Ex start with defaults, root priviliges are needed for to listen on port 25:
$ sudo ./devbox.py

With port 2525 and a different maildir:
$ ./devbox.py -p 2525 -m /tmp/mails
